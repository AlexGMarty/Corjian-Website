<h1>A 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Campaign</h1>
<hr>
<p>A newly discovered continent has governments and rich investors seeking to claim as much as they can. However, when the dangers of this new land prove too much to handle, a call for adventurers is put out to speed up exploration. The pay is high, but so is the risk. Do you have what it takes to venture into the wilds and make it back alive?</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Corjian.<br>I am Alex Marty, your Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>This is the official website for my home-brewed, 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons game that is played every Tuesday and features an adventuring party consisting of five players.</p>
<p>To your left, you may follow links to explore the world of Corjian, the characters playing in the game, and events that have taken place in the game so far.</p>
<p>Enjoy your tour, and remember: It's almost Tuesday.</p>
