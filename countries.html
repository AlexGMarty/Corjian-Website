<h3>Society:</h3><p> The original survivors of the Divine Cataclysm on Flomb were a tribe of drow living near a system of underground lakes. It was several millennia before any significant number ventured above ground, and the three major cities of Flomb (Flyst, Florian, and Fluskan) remain underground to this day. This has made immigration to the island difficult, so most of the population is still made up of descendants from the original drow colony, although some outsiders have integrated and been welcomed by the generally enthusiastically friendly Flombians.</p>

<h3>Politics:</h3><p> Religious Oligarchy. The government is headed by a trifecta of Cardinals from the Church of Flombax. Each of these Cardinals represents one of the three major underground cities, Flyst, Florian, or Fluskan, and divides their time between governing Flomb as a whole and leading their respective local governments and churches. Cardinals are technically elected to lifetime terms, but it's rare for a Cardinal to actually serve until their death. It is seen as conventional, respectful, and beneficial for Flomb that they choose to step down when they have either accomplished what they sought to accomplish as Cardinal or failed to do so. When a Cardinal steps down, the High Priests and High Priestesses of their respective city elect a new Cardinal from among their own ranks.</p>

<h3>Economy:</h3><p> Flombians tend to live simple lives and are generally self-sufficient within their island. There is minimal trade with outsiders. Fishing and underground mushroom farms are the biggest food sources and make up the biggest chunk of the economy.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3><p> The most ubiquitous trait of Flombians is their devotion to their strange religion. Nearly all inhabitants of the small country worship Flombax the Tentacle King, a God otherwise unheard of elsewhere in the world. The Church of Flombax has many teachings, but all center around The Three Pillars: Giving, Acceptance, and Trust.</p>

<h3>Military:</h3><p> Flomb has no standing army and local police forces are generally completely unarmed or close to it. The societal pressure to live a life according to the teachings of Flombax is a uniting force that keeps the vast majority of people happily rule abiding. Those who stray from the Church are politely shunned and often resort to self-exile, finding that shop owners and merchants suddenly seem to be unwilling to do business with them while smiling and apologizing for that being the case.</p>

<h3>Geography:</h3><p> The underdark beneath Flomb is rich with interconnected saltwater lakes and humid catacombs ideal for growing mushrooms and other fungi. Above ground, Flomb is mostly untouched by civilization. There are docks and some small villages, but otherwise the island is relatively unexplored wilderness.</p>

<h2>Free Isles of Challant</h2>

</center>
<h3>Society:</h3><p> Everyone looks, acts, and sounds like a pirate. But they're all extremely friendly and hospitable. The chaotic and often confusing nature of the government can leave outsiders befuddled, but the people who live in Challant seem to navigate that chaos effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Politics:</h3><p> Bureaucratic anarchy. Anything goes as long as you have the proper permits and licenses, and there's a form for everything. The people who live in Challant are very efficient at navigating the bureaucracy, but to outsiders it is excessively complicated and difficult. Government appointed Auditors within each island/town fastidiously take notes and check numbers to ensure proper licensing for all activities. They don't really have enforcement power, but are extremely willing to help correct any wrongs as seamlessly as possible. You want to rob the local pawn shop? Great! Wait, you're properly licensed with the Thieves' Guild, aren't you? And you've verified the pawn shop is on the list of robbery-eligible businesses? You haven't? Oh, dear…</p>

<h3>Economy:</h3><p> Above average GDP and everything is more expensive than most other places. It's also hard to find a lot of things that are common elsewhere, like many types of artisan's tools. Most shops, businesses, etc., are single entities owned by a single person or family with a small group of employees. Only a small handful of large corporations exist. Because of this dynamic, the goods and services offered from island to island or even neighborhood to neighborhood can vary substantially in terms of quality, quantity, and nature.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3><p> The population varies in terms of level of devotion, but many are devoted Fharlanghn, God of Horizons and Travel, whose dead body is said to have formed the islands of Challant and keeps the climate tropical. There also exist churches dedicated to Lathander (birth and renewal), Silvanus (wild nature), Umberlee (sea), and Habbakuk (animal life and the sea). Most people within Challant are open about their religion and generally don't pass judgment on the religious choices of others.</p>

<h3>Military:</h3><p> There are Enforcers who can be called upon by the Auditors in the event of noncompliance, but they are very rarely needed. When they are, though, things can get ugly. The people of Challant are very protective of their chaotic way of life and don't stand for breaches of etiquette or rule breaking. As such, Enforcers are held in very high regard and their decisions and actions, even when brutal, are seen as just.</p>

<h3>Geography:</h3><p> Challant is a collection of islands said to have formed from the dead body of Fharlanghn, a God slain in the Divine Cataclysm. Despite the Free Isles' location far to the south, Fharlanghn's spirit maintains a tropical climate amidst and otherwise icy and frigid ocean. The capital of Challant, Skeleton Quay, is built upon Fharlanghn's skull. Islands closer to the center of the Isles, including Skeleton Quay, are warm enough to sustain jungles and rain forests while islands further on the outskirts are somewhat more barren and temperate.</p>

<hr id="Koralia">
<h2>Koralia</h2>
<center>

</figure>
</center>
<h3>Society:</h3><p> Heavy dwarvish influence. The main population of Koralia was built from a tribe of duergar who survived the Divine Cataclysm. They eventually expanded above ground and across the continent by the time the different continents began to intermingle.</p>

<h3>Politics:</h3><p> The government is led by a single democratically-elected official called the Glasskeeper who selects his or her own advisory staff.  Glasskeeper elections occur every 20 years. Local city governments are headed by officials called Glasshands who are chosen and assigned by the Glasskeeper. The current Glasskeeper is a dwarf woman named Tirge who is generally thought of favorably.</p>
 
<h3>Economy:</h3><p> Trade is extremely important in Koralia. The continent spans a huge variety of climates and terrains, each one rich with different resources. The ability of the people of Koralia to acquire goods from other parts of the continent is key to the prosperity of each city and region. This has also made Koralian merchants shrewd and successful on the global stage, meaning the goods available even in inland desert towns are as varied and plentiful as anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3><p> A wide pantheon is worshipped across the continent. However, Shinare, God of Wealth and Trade, is particularly popular.</p>

<h3>Military:</h3><p> Koralia keeps a relatively large standing army compared to the size of its population, and that army is well-trained and well-funded. Their primary function is keeping trade routes safe and secure, both against bandits and against monsters. Because the safety of trade routes keeps the continent's bustling trade flowing, this function of the military is easy to justify financially.</p>

<h3>Geography:</h3><p> A large chunk of Central Koralia is covered by a desert made of a single, thick layer of glass that was created when the desert sand was super heated in battle during the Divine Cataclysm. The Glass Desert has a huge impact on the culture of the entire continent, though some who live in the coastal areas may roll their eyes at the desert dwellers. Many consider the desert a symbol of the strength of the people of Koralia.</p>

<hr id="Sola">
<h2>Sola</h2>
<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/flagsola.png" alt="Sola Flag" width="400px">
	<figcaption>Map design by Puck's player</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<h3>Society:</h3><p> The inhabitants of Sola grew out of a smattering of racially diverse, small tribes that survived the Divine Cataclysm. Due to the thick forest and jagged mountains of the continent, overland travel is quite difficult and so these tribes grew up entirely separated from each other until only a few thousand years ago. When the different groups did eventually discover each other, wars broke out. These wars lasted hundreds of years with no one making notable progress over anyone else. Because of the resources devoted to fighting, technological and other progress was stifled throughout the continent for many centuries. Eventually, an Archdruid named Brocktree Solanum began to emerge from the forests at battle sites before fighting began. He was able to convince the various peoples of the continent to drop their weapons and grudges in order to unite. Peace talks finally began and treaties were signed not long after. No one knows where Brocktree came from or where he went, but the continent was subsequently named Sola in his honor.</p>

<h3>Politics:</h3><p> Sola is made up of a small collection of independent city-states, each with its own independent government and laws. The treaties that have been in place for the past couple thousand years have maintained peace and openness between the different city-states, but they all still keep independence from each other.</p>

<h3>Economy:</h3><p> Sola is rich in natural resources: lumber, ore, precious metals, gemstones, and so on. These are the major exports of the continent, although the availability of each varies amongst the city-states depending on what's available in their respective regions. Sola lumber, specifically Sola Redwood, is particularly sought after, even in the far reaches of the world. Its red hue and durability don't occur naturally elsewhere and the trees themselves have resisted transplantation.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3><p> Religion is generally considered private by most people and typically not discussed. Some worship Brocktree Solanum as though he were a god, and some followers even claim that he still lives in the deepest parts of the forests, watching over the people of Sola.</p>

<h3>Military:</h3><p> Each city state has its own local police force. Some keep small standing armies or navies to fight off the dangers of the nearby wilderness.</p>

<h3>Geography:</h3><p> Sola's geography is varied: thick forests, jagged mountain ranges, harsh tundra, raging rivers, and infested swamps. The common thread between all areas is that they are all treacherous and filled with dangerous beasts and monsters.</p>

<h2>Xur & Zix</h2>
<center>

</figure>
</center>
<h3>Society:</h3><p> As best as historians can tell, Xur and Zix were originally populated by a tribe of forest gnomes following the Divine Cataclysm. At some point, the tribe split into two competing factions, both claiming to be the original. This disagreement and competition has since evolved into a cold war between two massive dynasties that has split the continent in half with the two capital cities, Xurtopia and Zixtopolis, on opposite sides of a large, frozen lake that now acts as a demilitarized zone. The leaders and citizens of Xurtopia and Zixtopolis carry a fierce disdain for their counterparts across the lake and would never consider any kind of productive or friendly relationship with the other.</p>

<p>On the other hand... Those who live outside the capitals sometimes have trouble feeling animosity towards the opposing dynasty. The further from the Xur and Zix border, the harder it is to remember why the two countries even oppose each other in the first place and the easier it is to think of peace and cooperation. Unfortunately, those outside the capitals have basically no influence on what the political leaders do. Even those within each capital barely have any influence or interaction with the royal families.</p>

<h3>Politics:</h3><p> Twin dynasties. Xur and Zix are led by the Xur and Zix families, respectively. These two families have been the political heads of each side for thousands of years, dating back to the original forest gnome tribe that survived the Divine Cataclysm. Queen Hollywell Fairschnickel Arsam Drangle Xur and King Horace Merkle Flospertingle Plimpton Zix share a bitter loathing for each other despite having never met or interacted at all, really.</p>

<p>Both dynasties are led by their Queen or King with a council of advisors. Most of the Queen's and King's desires are for undermining their counterpart on the other side of the lake, so most "real" governing is done by local city governments which run things pretty smoothly in spite of their national leaders.</p>

<h3>Economy:</h3><p> The biggest export from Xur and Zix is technology. The thousands years long grudge has led to fierce competition and innovation on top of typical gnomish ingenuity. Things like electric lighting, indoor plumbing, and free public transportation in the form of clockwork trolleys are common even in medium sized towns and poorer areas.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3><p>  A vast and varied pantheon exists in Xur and Zix and religious choices often differ from family to family or even person to person. Many Xurians and Zixians are not so keen on others' choices, however, and frequently gossip about and judge others' religions.</p>

<h3>Military:</h3><p> Most of the military on either side of the continent is focused on defending attacks from the other side. Neither side ever attacks the other.</p>

<h3>Geography:</h3><p> Mostly barren ice lands with some moderate mountain ranges and sparse forests. Even the warmest days of summer aren't enough to thaw the snow that covers both sides of the continent.</p>

<hr id="zjaihal">
<h2>Zjaihal</h2>
<center>
<figure>
	<img src="images/flagzjaihal.jpg" alt="Zjaihal Flag" width="400px">
	<figcaption>Map design by Azhian's player</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
<h3>Society:</h3><p> The people of Zjaihal tend to feel a deep pride for their home nation. An enormous titan slain by an equally large blade during the Divine Cataclysm was left to rot in the center of the continent and only the bones remain. The capital city of Zjaihal was formed beneath the bones and the people there mine the blade's metal.</p>

<h3>Politics:</h3><p> Democratic Republic. The major political parties are the churches of Savras (LN, god of divination & fate, knowledge domain), Tempus (N, god of war, war domain), and Leira (CN, goddess of illusion, trickery domain). Party elections occur every 8 years and the government itself consists of a parliament overseen by a prime minister. Seats in parliament are divided proportional to the votes received by each party and the prime minister is chosen by the party that controls the most seats. The current government is run by a Church of Tempus prime minister and parliament where the Church of Tempus controls a majority of the seats.
Politically, the Church of Savras tends to be conservative, the Church of Leira tends to be progressive, and the Church of Tempus strives for balance and would be considered moderate.</p>

<h3>Economy:</h3><p> Zjaihal as a whole is particularly well-known for its artisans. Skilled blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, glass blowers, and the like produce many of the finest manufactured goods in the world, from weapons and armor to furniture and dinnerware. Known as Titansteel, the metal mined from the enormous sword adjacent to the capital is difficult to mine but loved by blacksmiths and other artisans for its ability to be easily molded when heated yet incredibly strong and sturdy once cooled. Weapons made from Titansteel have a faint blue tint and take to enchantment easier than standard weapons.</p>

<h3>Religion:</h3><p> Religion is deeply tied to politics. It's very rare for anyone living in Zjaihal to worship any gods other than Savras, Tempus, or Leira, and most people are very open about their affiliation.</p>

<h3>Military:</h3><p> Zjaihal has always kept a disproportionately large military. High ranking members of the military also frequently hold positions within one of the three major churches, most commonly the church of Tempus. Because there's not much for that military to do, however, they have more or less been outsourced to other parts of the government such as local police forces, social work, and even private guards for noble families. The last five years have been very exciting for a small group of the Zjaihal military which has been put in charge of the exploration and conquest of Gren under the leader of the High Commander Serox, Archbishop of the Church of Tempus.</p>

<h3>Geography:</h3><p> Zjaihal spans a wide range of geographical features. The East, closer to Sola, is more heavily forested and mountainous. The West, closer to Koralia, is more barren and dry.</p>
