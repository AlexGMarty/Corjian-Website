# Corjian-Website
This website is a personal project I created as part of learning HTML and CSS and to show off information about my weekly Dungeons & Dragons game in my home brewed world called Corjian.

All code was written 100% from scratch by me. Many of the images were created by me in Adobe Photoshop. Content was mostly created by me with some input from the players in my game.
