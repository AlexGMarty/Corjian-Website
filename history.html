<p>
The world of Corjian was a single, prosperous continent. Modern luxuries were commonplace even for those who were less wealthy. Things like electric lighting, indoor plumbing, and public transportation were widely available even outside major cities.
</p><p>
Magic was extremely common. Hardly anyone in the world wasn't capable of at least some small amount of magic. Powerful mages, nowadays considered sinister and fearsome by some more superstitious folk, were revered and respected. The strength of a government or country could be measured by the power of its most skilled magicians.
</p><p>
A sort of magical arms race resulted in a rapid expansion of magical abilities and discovery of new, novel magics. A few archmagi who could wield these powers saw an opportunity to grab power for themselves. But they were smart enough to know not a single one of them was strong enough to stand against the combined power of the others.
</p><p>
Instead of attempting to destroy each other, the archmagi spurred their countries and governments, joining forces together with a different intention - to destroy the gods and claim a position of ultimate power.
</p><p>
A war ensued between the archmagi and the pantheon of gods that existed at the time, and the world was torn apart both literally and figuratively. Things began and ended quickly, and the level of destruction was all-encompassing.
</p><p>
The single continent of Corjian was ripped into pieces, resulting in the current geographical arrangement of smaller continents. This new world found itself filled with the kinds of geographical peculiarities that can only occur as a result of gods dying.
</p><p>
The moon god was slain in the battle so there are six shattered pieces of the moon that hang in the sky now, orbiting the planet as well as themselves. 
</p><p>
The war goddess claimed a vast territory and her essence still hangs in her land. Historians and theologians speculate it is impossible to maintain peace for the people in that vale, and hence the peoples of Xur & Zix have been in a cold war for thousands of years. 
</p><p>
Spring is a place now in Sola. The god of Spring was trapped in a lake so now to experience that season one needs to go to the land around that lake. Everywhere else winter fades immediately to summer. Every summer brings flooding as all the snow immediately turns to water and rushes downstream. 
</p><p>
A desert of pure, smooth, thick glass, the result of sand being super-heated in a battle, covers much of the central landmass of Koralia. 
</p><p>
An enormous titan slain by an equally large blade was left to rot and only the bones remain. The capital city of Zjaihal was formed beneath the bones and the people there mine the blade's metal. 
</p><p>
The partially submerged skull of a dead God lies in the Southern sea, giving off a tremendous amount of heat. This skull has become Skeleton Quay, the capital of Challant, and the radiating heat caused by the island-sized skull supports a tropical climate even in the frigid Southern seas. 
</p><p>
Following the war, civilization as a whole crumbled. Any city, town, or village significant enough to be written on a map was flattened, razed, burned down, flooded, frozen over, or sunken into the ground or sea.
</p><p>
The vast majority of the world's population perished. The rare survivors were those lucky enough to be traveling between civilized parts of the world when the war began, the scattered nomadic tribes who lived entirely outside of civilization altogether, and monsters and other creatures reclusive enough to be untouched by such an event.
</p><p>
It is from these rare survivors that the world started anew and spent 10,000 years growing into what it is today.
</p><p>
This war between the archmagi and the gods is known as the Divine Cataclysm and everything I have just told you amounts to the cumulative sum of knowledge about that time period.
</p><p>
The bulk of the ensuing eon was simply population growth and expansion. Each new continent started as the home to bare hundreds or mere dozens of survivors and it was several thousands of years before anything resembling a city came to exist again.

Seafaring technology sufficient for intercontinental travel only emerged about 1500 years ago. By necessity of their own geography, the Free Isles of Challant were the first to discover they were not the only survivors of the Divine Cataclysm. Explorers discovered the neighboring continents of Sola and Zix around this time, but it took another 500 years before any level of productive interaction between civilizations began to establish itself. 
</p><p>
Between 1000 and 500 years ago, a renaissance of sorts was propelled forward by the intermingling of the world's civilizations. Trade of resources, culture, and technology quickly served to connect all the different peoples of the world. Eventually, those who could afford to immigrate saw the option to do so as a bright opportunity rather than an adventurous act of folly.
</p><p>
Since as recently as 200 years ago, all the cultures of the world have been truly intermingled. Natives of Zjaihal or Xur can commonly be found as far spread as Challant or Sola. Even the reclusive inhabitants of Flomb, acolytes of their strange religion, have ventured out into the rest of the world and become a bit of an everyday novelty.
</p><p>
For a century, the world enjoyed peace, prosperity, and contentment.
</p><p>
Mostly.
</p><p>
For some, the world was still too small. The advancements in seafaring technology that now allowed one to travel from the southernmost reaches of Xur to the northernmost reaches of Sola without needing to stop along the way also meant explorers could travel far out in any direction. What if there was more out there? What if another continent existed, split off during the Divine Cataclysm, waiting to be discovered and reunited with the rest of the world?
</p><p>
With funding from wealthy nobles and even some governments, explorers took to the vast, open ocean and…nothing was discovered. At least, not by the groups of explorers who managed to return home.
</p><p>
Until 100 years ago, that is.

A lucky or possibly foolish crew depending on your outlook, ventured west far beyond what was considered safe in an exploration vessel simply named Winter. They sailed to where navigating at night meant imagining new constellations formed by unfamiliar stars in an unfamiliar sky. By the time they made their discovery, half the crew was considering mutiny to force the ship to turn around and the other half were only complacent because they thought it was too late to turn around anyway.
</p><p>
After two months of sailing with no land in sight, the crew of the Winter spotted…not land…but a massive wall of fog. No, not a wall. A ring. A ring of fog wider across than the glass desert of Koralia or the deepest forest of Sola. Large enough to encompass the entirety of the Free Isles of Challant.

<p>
Not wanting to push their luck, the Winter returned home to report their findings.
</p><p>
As news spread, a flurry of additional ships were sent to explore the ring of fog. Over the next several years, every expedition was met with disappointment or worse. It wasn't long before ships attempted to sail into the fog, but the same thing happened every time. Every single ship that sailed into the fog simply vanished and never returned.
</p><p>
Not so easily dissuaded, ships began to bring along crew members skilled in magics to deal with whatever lay beyond the fog. Still, not a single ship returned.
</p><p>
Several more years passed with attempts at penetrating the fog becoming more rare and desperate. None were successful. Eventually, a whole year passed without any attempts at penetrating the fog. Eventually, a whole decade. Eventually, attempts stopped altogether.
</p><p>
The fog ring, by this time, had faded from excitement and settled into being a mere novelty.
</p><p>
The government of Zjaihal still funded an annual expedition ship to travel to the fog ring, circle it, look for any changes, and return home. These expeditions continued to be uneventful for many years.
</p><p>
Then, five years ago, the Zjaihal expedition ship made a discovery. Part of the Western boundary of the fog ring had receded, revealing a small piece of land jutting out from the fog.
</p><p>
Once news made its way back to the rest of the world, every country rushed to pour resources into exploration of the newly discovered continent, since named Gren. Over the past five years, a city has been established on the coast at the mouth of a river that has emerged as the fog has slowly continued to recede. This city is called Winter's Edge in honor of the crew of the Winter who originally discovered the fog ring.
</p><p>
As the fog has continued to recede, two additional towns have been set up further inland, but the dense forest, tall mountains, and other difficult terrain of the island have made exploration slow. As such, the leaders of Winter's Edge have put out a call for adventurers to travel to Gren and aid with the exploration. The pay is high, but so is the risk as many have already fallen to Gren's myriad monsters and other dangers.
